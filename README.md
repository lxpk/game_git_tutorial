# game_git_tutorial
making a game starting with a git repo

# CONCEPT
* a math game about adding and dividing
* first-person perspective
* walking around
* blocks represent numbers
* blocks represent operators like + - / *
* Move blocks to get math results
* unity will work for this

# DESIGN

## minimal start
* two blocks with numbers on them
* ability to grab and position blocks on into a grid that makes math expressions
* Eg. "2" "+" "2" "=" 
* This would spit out 4
* Fill in the blanks mechanics
* just put things and get results

## phase 2 ...
* Learning algebra by knowing the answer and filling in X Y terms

## ultimate vision
* Learning math by manipulating number and op blocks like portal

# CHANGELIST
* Demonstrate todos and push to git
* Create GIT LFS .gitattributes file
* Create Unity project
* Import a FPS character prefab from the asset store
* Upload
* Create github issues for the core prototype mechanics



# TODO LIST
* Define minimal version, future phases, and ultimate vision
